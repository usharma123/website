        <p>
        I'm a builder at the intersection of AI, healthcare, and law, passionate about turning complex, manual workflows into smart systems. 
        I co-founded Patent-It AI to streamline patent and legal diligence, cutting hours of work to minutes. 
        With a background in biomedical engineering, AI, and clinical research, Iâ€™ve led teams across projects from GAN-based medical imaging to agentic RAG tools for litigation. I thrive in research-driven, user-focused environments and am currently scaling tools that support decision-making in regulated spaces.
